"To get started, install the Node modules by running 'npm install'. If the installation fails, ensure that you are in the 'Little-Lemon' directory. If not, navigate to it by using 'cd Little-Lemon'."
"Alternatively, you can copy and paste to replace the 'public' and 'src' directories with another React app."
"If you encounter any errors while running 'npm start', please install the following dependencies:
'npm install react-router-dom'
'npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons'
'npm install yup'
'npm install formik'"
